# Space-Invaders
During a week of a summer bridge program for incoming engineer transfers we made a group project.

How far can you get?

Rules:
You have 10 lives. 
Each time you are hit you will lose a life.
Aliens take 2 hits.
Magenta colored aliens are "special" aliens. Destroying them will randomly get you +1 Health, +1 Strength, or double the points.
Don't let the aliens reach the bottom!!!
